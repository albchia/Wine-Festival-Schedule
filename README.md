### Project Overview

Title: _"Wine Festival Schedule"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Wine-Festival-Schedule.git)

This is a common flow for front-end web developers: typically provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to a functional actual website.

The design prototype used for this project is inspired by an event time-table. The task is to create the very basic and simple structure of a webpage, starting playing with HTML elements (particularly `tables`).

### Project Instructions

Feel free to customize information and style the webpage.

It's time to build fluency in HTML Tables.
In this Codecademy Pro project, we are going to practice _tabular organization in HTML_ so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world.

If you are going to have data on a webpage, you have got to master the skills of effectively and aesthetically organizing it -an HTML `table` is the perfect solution.

Use your HTML knowledge of HTML to display a table to the attendees.
