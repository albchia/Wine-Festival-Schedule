### Project Overview

Title: _"Fashion Blog"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Fashion-Blog-Project.git)

This is a common flow for front-end web developers: typically provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to a functional actual website.

The design prototype used for this project is inspired by fashion blogs. The task is to create the very basic and simple structure of a webpage, starting playing with HTML elements.

### Project Instructions

Feel free to customize information and style the webpage.

It's time to build fluency in HTML Fundamentals.
In this Codecademy Pro project, we are going to practice structure in HTML so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world.

This project will help you to understand and master the _building blocks of a webpage_. What's next? A blogger, a developer, a stylish website!

Use your HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog.
Make sure to include `pictures`, `lists`, `links`, and other `HTML elements` that you have learned.
